# GuessTheCodeHack
This script allows you to discover the language chosen in GuessThisCode.

I looked at the source code of this website when I saw JavaScript was written clearly and it wasn't encrypted and then I created this program. 

But it's only for fun,so please Mansoor Codes do not get mad if you read this repo ğŸ˜¢ğŸ˜¢ğŸ˜¢

Follow [Mansoor Codes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdtys5fMiaI_NJPeshNzxMQ) on YouTube ğŸ˜œ

I wrote this script when I was 15 yr old.
